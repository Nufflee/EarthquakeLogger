# EarthquakeLogger
Very simple system I made in ~2.5 days that logs accelerometer ([ST LSM9DS1](https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/lsm9ds1.html)) data over WiFi using an ESP32.

Created in the wake of [M5.4 Zagreb earthquake](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us70008dx7/executive) that happened 6 days ago - I'm running this 24/7 logging to a Raspberry Pi in hope of detecting one of the subsequent aftershocks.

Still very WIP.
